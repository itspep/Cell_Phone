Creating the CellPhone Class
Wireless Solutions, Inc., is a business that sells cell phones and wireless service. You are a
programmer in the company’s information technology (IT) department, and your team is
designing a program to manage all of the cell phones that are in inventory. You have been
asked to design a class that represents a cell phone. The data that should be kept as fields in
the class are as follows:
•	 The name of the phone’s manufacturer will be assigned to the manufact field.
•	 The phone’s model number will be assigned to the model field.
•	 The phone’s retail price will be assigned to the retailPrice field.
The class will also have the following methods:
•	 A constructor that accepts arguments for the manufacturer, model number, and retail price.
•	 A setManufact method that accepts an argument for the manufacturer. This method
will allow us to change the value of the manufact field after the object has been created, if necessary.
•	 A setModel method that accepts an argument for the model. This method will allow
us to change the value of the model field after the object has been created, if necessary.
•	 A setRetailPrice method that accepts an argument for the retail price. This method
will allow us to change the value of the retailPrice field after the object has been
created, if necessary.

•	 A getManufact method that returns the phone’s manufacturer.
•	 A getModel method that returns the phone’s model number.
•	 A getRetailPrice method that returns the phone’s retail price.
